LolRSS is a simple feed agregator written in perl for fun's sake.

File storage changed to sqlite. Implementation in progress.

Here is how the CLI should work in the show feed part:

step 1:        step 2:		step 3:
|-FeedName1    |-FeedName1	|-FeedName1 
|-FeedName2    |  |		|  |
|-FeedName3    |  |--Title1	|  |--Title1
	       |  |--Title2  	|  |   |
	       |  |--Title3	|  |   |--Conten
	       |		|  |   |  ReadMore: Y/n ?		
	       |-FeedName2	|  |   
	       |-FeedName3	|  |--Title2
	       			|  |--Title3
				|  
				|-FeedName2
				|-FeedName3

Using termcaps, the CLI should provide underlining of the curent selection.
Navigation will be done using right, left, up and down. 
Unroll sections will be done using enter and "reroll" section using esc.
ReadMore will open default web broser to read the article on the website.
